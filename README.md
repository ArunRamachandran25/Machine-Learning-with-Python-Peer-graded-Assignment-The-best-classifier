# Machine-Learning-with-Python-Peer-graded-Assignment-The-best-classifier
In this project, you will complete a notebook where you will build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.   You load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models: k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression. The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable: Jaccard index, F1-score, Log Loss.
